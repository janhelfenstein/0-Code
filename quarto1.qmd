Re-do the tasks you did in RBTL course

```{r}
library(gapminder)

gapminder_2007 <- gapminder |>
    filter(year == 2007)

plot1 <- ggplot(data = gapminder_2007,
      mapping = aes(x = continent,
                   y = lifeExp,
                   fill = continent
                   )
      ) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = "Life expectancy in 2007 by continent")

ggsave("life-exp-2007.png", plot = plot1, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```
