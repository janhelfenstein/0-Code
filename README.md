# 0-Code
Hi. I am just getting started with coding and with git.

This project is to refresh my python knowledge.
Also, I'm trying to work on a hobby of mine:
Analyze data of runners in Switzerland, so I can compare myself with them.

I also use R to analyze data.
I use Jupyter notebooks and Quarto to create documents.
